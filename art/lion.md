# Neon Lion - Paint by Numbers (December 2025) 
**Medium** Acrylic paint by numbers on canvasboard 
**time** completed in a single session lasting about 3 hours 
**notes** This piece was chaotic, bright , frustrating and a little triumphant.  I remember finishing the eyes and watching it come to life.

## process and thoughts 
I picked this one because the colours were striking and felt loud in the best possible way,  i don't draw because i can't but paint by numbers give me a nice way to exist in the creative zone without being bummed out by lack of ability.  the lion was difficult, the lines had to be sharp and the details were tiny.
