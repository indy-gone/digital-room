# The Digital Room 
Welcome. I'm Indigo (a.k.a Indy-gone).
This space will become a digital room - part archive, part bedroom, part museum. A place where I put art, crafts, code, projects, memories, strange ideas, and whatever feels real or important 
Nothing here is necessarily finished. Some shelves are empty. Some lights flicker. But exploring is encouraged 
Stay tuned whilst the room comes together.
